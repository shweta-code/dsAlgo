/*Given an array a, your task is to convert it into a non-increasing form such that we can either increment or
 decrement the array value by 1 in minimum changes possible.

        Examples :

        Input : a[] = {3, 1, 2, 1}
        Output : 1
        Explanation :
        We can convert the array into 3 1 1 1 by
        changing 3rd element of array i.e. 2
        into its previous integer 1 in one step
        hence only one step is required.

        Input : a[] = {3, 1, 5, 1}
        Output : 4
        We need to decrease 5 to 1 to make array sorted
        in non-increasing order.

        Input : a[] = {1, 5, 5, 5}
        Output : 4
        We need to increase 1 to 5.*/
