* Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so for in efficient way. For simplicity assume there are no duplicates. For example, let us consider the stream 5, 15, 1, 3 â€¦

After reading 1st element of stream - 5 -> median - 5
After reading 2nd element of stream - 5, 15 -> median - 10
After reading 3rd element of stream - 5, 15, 1 -> median - 5
After reading 4th element of stream - 5, 15, 1, 3 -> median - 4, so on...
Making it clear, when the input size is odd, we take the middle element of sorted data. If the input size is even, we pick average of middle two elements in sorted stream.

Note that output is effective median of integers read from the stream so far. Such an algorithm is called online algorithm. Any algorithm that can guarantee output of i-elements after processing i-th element, is said to be online algorithm
