# DS - Algo

**Concepts**

1. Heaps are complete Binary Tree.
2. Tree Map/ Red Black Trees in JAVA - [Internal Working of TreeMap in Java - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-working-of-treemap-in-java/)


// Algorithmic Questions for

Binary Search - Edge Case - low, mid, high are same element
low and mid = i ; high = i+1

``


**Google Preparation**

a) Framework -

1. Clarify - Validity of Input, Limits of input, Return Type, Input Type, return modulo?, Longs/Integers?
2. Assume - If input is sorted
3. Start Simple - Define scope, input and expected output during this exercise. Ask for optimization that needs to be done- Time Complexity and Space Complexity
4. Iterate
5. Implement

b)  Have to do Combinatorics, Divide and Conquer, BST question too, Binary Search Algo, Water Rain Trapping, Montone Increasing Q, [Word Ladder - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/), Heap, [Subtree of Another Tree - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

c) Binary Search Questions- [Binary Search Interview Questions - Google, Facebook, Amazon - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9QJ8HaRvJQ)

d) [Google Spring' 23 High Frequency - Study Plan - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/google-spring-23-high-frequency/)

**How to go about preparation of DSA?**

1) Reading questions/answers -> 3 LRU cache, Trie
2) Thinking -> 2
3) Writing -> 1
4) Revision -> Previous topics
